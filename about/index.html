      <p>I’ve been a computer nerd my whole life.<br />
My first computer (my dad’s) was a dual eight inch floppy drive TeleVideo.<br />
My first gaming rig was an Apple II+. (Hi Woz!)<br />
I’ve read Applied Cryptography, and the Jargon file.<br />
And listened to every episode of “Off The Hook”.<br /><br /></p>

<p>My passion for learning began during the formative years. And as with so many, being the introvert I am, this got directed to learning and understanding computers. But my understanding didn’t really take off until late 1999 when I first discovered Minix and then Linux and the GNUs that brought it all to life.<br /><br /></p>

<p>How a computer works… networking, graphics, file systems, terminals, the command line. The power of the command line. Microsoft hid much from the user. I had discovered GNU/Linux… and I wanted to learn it all.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Two decades later, I haven’t learned it all, but I’m working on it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Oh, and I also love to teach.</p>
